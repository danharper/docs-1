The `upstash-vector` SDK is a lightweight, HTTP-based Upstash Vector client designed for Python. It seamlessly operates in both serverless and serverful environments, ensuring optimal compatibility across various connection setups.

This SDK simplifies interaction with Upstash Vector through the [Upstash Vector API](https://docs.upstash.com/vector/features/restapi). /* TODO-BURAK: Update this link to the correct one */

It is designed to work with Python versions 3.8 and above.
