title: Fetch
---

## Method

The `fetch` method allows you to retrieve vectors from the index based on their identifiers. It takes the following input parameters:

- `ids`: A string or a list of strings representing the identifiers of the vectors to be fetched.
- `include_vectors`: A boolean flag indicating whether to include vectors in the fetch results.
- `include_metadata`: A boolean flag indicating whether to include metadata in the fetch results.

As a response, following field is returned:

- `vectors`: A list containing information for each fetched vector, including `id`, `vector`, and `metadata`.

## Fetch Example

```python
from upstash_vector import Index

index = Index.from_env()

# Specify the identifiers of vectors to be fetched
ids_to_fetch = ["id1", "id2", "id3"]

# Fetch the specified vectors with vectors and metadata included
fetch_result = index.fetch(ids=ids_to_fetch, include_vectors=True, include_metadata=True)

# Display the fetched vectors
for vector_info in fetch_result.vectors:
    print("ID:", vector_info.id)
    print("Vector:", vector_info.vector)
    print("Metadata:", vector_info.metadata)
    print()
```

Alternatively, you can delete a singular vector:

```python
index.fetch("id-4")
```
